# 🏧 ATM Simulation Project

A **Python-based ATM simulation** built with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
This project demonstrates key OOP concepts like **encapsulation**, while simulating real-world ATM functionalities such as **PIN creation**, **secure login**, **deposit**, **withdrawal**, and **balance inquiry** — all through a simple menu-driven interface.
